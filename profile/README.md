## 🌍 Introduction

There is a certain poetry in digging downward. Each block removed is a choice, each descent a quiet wager with danger. **Dig, Dig, Die** thrives on this tension — hunger ticking, enemies lurking, darkness pressing close.

The **Dig, Dig, Die Trainer** is not here to silence the game’s voice, but to let you decide its tempo. Faster. Kinder. Or mercilessly efficient. This is a precision tool for players who want command over systems, not shortcuts without thought.
